# Golang Awesome References

Go is a programming language created by Google in 2009. It is a statically-typed language with syntax similar to C, and it is designed for high-performance and concurrent programming. Go is commonly used for building web applications, distributed systems, and other types of software.

Some of the strong sides of Go language are:

- [x] Easy to learn and use - Go has a simple and clean syntax that is easy to learn and understand.
- [x] High performance - Go is a compiled language that produces fast and efficient code.
- [x] Scalability and concurrency - Go has built-in support for concurrency and parallelism, which allows it to handle large workloads and scale easily.
- [x] Robust standard library - Go has a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of features and functions for developing applications.
- [x] Strong community - Go has a large and active community of developers who contribute to the language and its ecosystem, providing support, tools, and resources for users.

## Dependency Injetion

### [Wire: Automated Initialization in Go](https://github.com/google/wire)

> Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using dependency injection. Dependencies between components are represented in Wire as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of global variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection, code written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written initialization.
> For an overview, see the [introductory blog post](https://go.dev/blog/wire).
